# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Simple Data Structures and Algorithms as well as concepts required for the algorithms


## Current Algorithms Created:

1. Search Algorithms
* Linear Search
* Binary Search
* Interpolation Search

2. Sort Algorithms
* Bubble Sort 
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort

3. Concepts
* Recursion
    * Simple recursion method and comaprison between iteration and recusion (recursion.java)
    * An example of recursion with a factorial calculator (recursion_factorial.java)
    * Another example of recursion by creating the power of two numbers

## Tasks in progress:
* Explaining each algorithm in README
* Adding more concepts required for algorithms
